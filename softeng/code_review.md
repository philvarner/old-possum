# Code Review

## PR/MR

Comments / discussion are not a system of record -- don't be concerned about taking discussions out of
the platform and into other message or video conferencing.  Consolidate and summarize discussions either into
the PR, ticket, or as documentation in the changeset itself.

For each person added, state explicitly what you're looking for. What should this look like?

- eyes-on
- specific comments
- would you submit this PR?
- validate approach
- verify implementation
- testing
