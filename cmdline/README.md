# Command Line

## Terminals

MacOS's Terminal is pretty bare-bones, so most people use other ones.

* [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) - support for tabs
* [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) - fast, beautiful rendering, good for tmux

## Command Line

* [Starship](https://starship.rs/)

## Screen multiplexers

* tmux
* screen

## Tools

* [lnav](http://lnav.org/) The Log File Navigator
* journalctl [tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-journalctl-to-view-and-manipulate-systemd-logs)


## Tricks

* adding `--` to many command line tools indicates the flags have ended. This means `ls -- -l` will list a file named `-l`
