## Data Structures

* Hash table, hash map, associative array, and dictionary refer to the same data structure. A symbol table is
  usually implemented using a hash table, and is sometimes referred to synonymously. 
* Bag - add and iterate, non-unique
* Set - add and iterate, unique
* Queue - FIFO
* Pushdown stack - LIFO
* List
* Non-empty List 
* Array
* Vector
* Chain - list-like, with constant time prepending and appending. See 
  [Cats Chain](https://typelevel.org/cats/datatypes/chain.html)
* Binary tree

## Sorts

### Insertion Sort
